Windingmachine


This winding machine can be used to produce fibre reinforced tubes. The dimensions of the tubes can be customised for use in sports and camping equipment, for example. The machine uses the tape laying or tape winding process, where unidirectional reinforced plastic tapes are wound around the core and bonded to the lower layers using a heat source.
