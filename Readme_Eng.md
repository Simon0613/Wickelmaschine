Windingmachine

This winding machine was developed and built as part of a master's thesis at the University of Applied Sciences in Osnabr√ºck, Germany.  

This winding machine can be used to produce fibre reinforced tubes. The dimensions of the tubes can be customised for use in sports and camping equipment, for example. The machine uses the tape laying or tape winding process, where unidirectional reinforced plastic tapes are wound around the core and bonded to the lower layers using a heat source.

The winding machine can be produced using simple manufacturing methods. Most of the components can be produced using an FDM 3D printer. Standard parts such as bolts, screws, bearings, heat sink inserts and springs are used. The power unit includes stepper motors and other parts you can find in 3D printers, such as GT2 pulleys and belts, the Arduino uno and a CNC shield. The other components are semi-finished materials, such as tubes and profiles, which need to be machined with drills, saws and files.
